# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.


num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))

num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2

print("The sum of" , num1 , "and", num2, "is:" , sum_result)
